/*
    Properties:
    1. Not in the scope of class.
    2. It just says you are my friend and you can access some of my data.
    3. Since, It's not in the class It can't be called from the object of the class.
    4. Can be invoked without the help of any object (directly accessible in main).
    5. Usually contains the arguments as object.
    6. Can be declared in public or in private.
    7. It can't access directly any memeber it need membership operator (object_name.member_name) to access any member.
