//It's somewhat related to DSA

STL:- Standard Template Library
    It's a library of Generic Classes and Function
    In a hackathon, competetive coding we have time limit.
    we can use prebuilt classes and functions of a STL and get our job done quick.
Through STL we can use well tested, optimized components.
Components of STL:-  they all use template function
    1. Containers
        Stores DATA like Vector
    2. Algorithms
        ex:- Sorting, Searching
    3. Iterators
        it's a object and points to an element in a container
        Handled just like pointer but it's an object
        connects alogrithms with container.
Example:-
a container  =>  [1|7|12|18|42]

Types of Containers:-
    1. Sequence Containers
        stores data in linear fashion  A -> B -> C -> D -> E like this
        Ex: Vector, List, Dequeue
    2. Associative Containers
        Gives us direct access to data.
        Ex: map, multi map, set, multi set
    3. Derived Containers
        derived from Sequence or Associative containers and do real world modeling
        Ex: Stack(lifo), Queue(fifo), Priority Queue
When use which one?
    Sequence Containers:-
        Vectors:-
            Random access -> Fast
            Insertion, Deletetion in middle -> Slow
            Insertion, Deletetion in end -> Fast
        List:-
            Random access -> Slow
            Insertion, Deletetion in middle -> Fast
            Insertion, Deletetion in end -> Fast
    Associative Containers:-
        All operations are fast except Random access.
    Derived Containers:-
        We've to do analysis every time.
